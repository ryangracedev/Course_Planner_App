Current Time Spent on VBA (both research and development): 3 hours

Event driven and object oriented

To enable developer tab:
file > options > customize ribbon

Then check the box beside "developer" on the right side

You can record a macro through developer > record macro then after choosing settings
then it'll record until you press stop recording

single quote is for commenting

macro is initially created like this:

Sub Macro1()

End Sub

Create variables like this: 

Dim MyString As String
    MyString = "Wow!"

If and For syntax:

If value = "true" Then
	do stuff
Else
	do other stuff
End If

Dim i as Integer
For i = 2 to 10
	do stuff
Next i

You can compare two strings using StrComp(str1,str2)

Will return 0 on equal and nonzero when not

This seems like a problem because vba assumes 0 is false and 1 is true

The immediate window can be used like a console for testing macros

create a form with vba: https://excelmacromastery.com/vba-userform/

course = Application.InputBox("Enter Course", "Course Code:") will open a form asking for course code, and assign in variable

A form can be created to add items to the file, can also receive items and use them to search on the excel file
